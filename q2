Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
Answer: Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
We can modify our previous example to demonstrate this by adding thread information to our print statements:

When you run this code, you'll see that both the view and the signal handler execute in the same thread, proving that Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default.

# models.py
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import time
from datetime import datetime
import threading

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal handler started at {datetime.now()} in thread {threading.current_thread().name}")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running process
    print(f"Signal handler finished at {datetime.now()} in thread {threading.current_thread().name}")

# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import MyModel

def create_model(request):
    print(f"View started at {datetime.now()} in thread {threading.current_thread().name}")
    MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
    print(f"View finished at {datetime.now()} in thread {threading.current_thread().name}")
    return HttpResponse("Model created")
